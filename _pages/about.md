I’m a Ph.D. candidate in Applied Data Science at the University of Stavanger. My research focuses on privacy-preserving machine learning (e.g., federated learning). I also build software end-to-end and enjoy teaching.

In the past, I worked as a co-founder or early developer at three startups, completed internships at global firms such as AWS and Equinor, and taught courses in machine learning, artificial intelligence, and big data analytics at Yonsei University’s Graduate School of Information.
